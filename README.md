# What I Learned from the CSS Course

After completing this course, I’ve gained a foundational understanding of how CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and visually enhance HTML content. I approached each topic with patience and curiosity, and while I still have more to learn, this has been a meaningful step in my journey toward becoming confident in web development.

## 📚 Topics I Explored

### 🎨 CSS Basics
- Learned how to link CSS to HTML using the `<style>` tag and external stylesheets via `<link>`.
- Understood how CSS rules are structured using **selectors**, **properties**, and **values**.

### 🧱 Selectors and Specificity
- Practiced using element, class (`.class`), and ID (`#id`) selectors.
- Discovered how to apply styles to multiple elements and how specificity affects rule application.

### 🌈 Colors, Fonts, and Text
- Styled text using properties like `color`, `font-family`, `font-size`, and `text-align`.
- Learned how to use HEX, RGB, and named colors effectively.

### 📏 Box Model and Spacing
- Got familiar with the box model: `content`, `padding`, `border`, and `margin`.
- Learned how to use `width`, `height`, and how `box-sizing` influences layout behavior.

### 🧭 Layout Techniques
- Explored layout techniques including:
  - `display: block`, `inline`, `inline-block`, and `none`
  - Centering elements with `margin: auto`
  - Flexbox basics for responsive and structured layout

### 🎯 Pseudo-Classes and Pseudo-Elements
- Practiced with `:hover`, `:first-child`, `::before`, and `::after` to add interactive styling and decorative elements.

### 📁 Organizing CSS
- Started keeping my CSS neat and modular by using external stylesheets and commenting code for clarity.

## 🌱 What’s Next

I now feel more confident writing CSS and look forward to deepening my understanding of responsive design, advanced Flexbox and Grid layouts, and mastering transitions and animations. This course was a valuable step, and I'm grateful for the growth it offered.
